Hashicorp git doc homework assignment.
## Instructions

This exercise should take no more than 90 minutes. 

Create a new GitHub repository with the following content as the first commit. Make a branch and open a PR to edit the text for clarity, and include any questions about the content's meaning, as if you were editing a colleague’s work. Please construct your commits, commit messages, and PR description as you would for an actual PR, but do not worry about making too many changes. Any changes that you think will improve the text are welcome. If anything in the text doesn’t match your opinion on a best practice, feel free to correct the meaning of the text.

Construct your PR to teach the author:
- Make atomic commits.
- Write your commit messages to show your rationale for edits.

Edit the text, as heavily as you like, so that it is easy to read:
- Correct errors.
- Put the text in active voice and present tense.
- Address the reader as you, not we.
- Phrase statements as positive rather than negative.
- Make the language simple and plain. 
- Avoid euphemisms.
- Structure the text so it has a logical flow. 

Once you're finished with your edits, send the PR link to the HashiCorp people team.
